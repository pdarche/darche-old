	"body": "I'm remaking my personal webite.  As you can see it's quite spartan.  That will change.  Slowly and consistently, I hope.  As noted in the description, my natural tendency when enganging in projects is to plan.  Get everything right then implement.  Unfortunately, I'm (like most people, I presume) bad at getting everything right in this planning phase and then find myself cobbling together a half-baked projects that are larger, less complete, and less functional than I'd like.",
